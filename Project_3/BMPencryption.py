    # This is a simple Python (2) or sage program to open, read and write a .bmp file.
    # Your task is to modify it so that the payload (but not the header) of
    # the .bmp file is encrypted.

    # NOTE: in Sage, first upload the file >Gompei.bmp< onto the server using
    # Data... --> Upload or create file  and then choosing the file from your machine
    # next, use "Data... --> Upload or create file" to create the empty file
    # >Gompei_enc.bmp<. After you have your program working, you can download the modified
    # >Gompei_enc.bmp< by clicking on "Data... --> Gompei_enc.bmp" and then choosing and
    # downloading from the provided link to the file.
